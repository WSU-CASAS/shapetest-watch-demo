# N-Back/Shape Test Watch Interface Demo
This project provides a demo version of the n-back prompt (called shape test in this project) that is shown as part of the Activity Learning watch app.

## Running
You will need to download the project and use Xcode on a Mac to open and view the project. Using Xcode, you can run the app on a physical Apple Watch or in a simulator. (App was designed to work on 41mm Apple Watch, though other sizes should work.)

You can choose to start an English or Spanish shape test, as well as view the results.
